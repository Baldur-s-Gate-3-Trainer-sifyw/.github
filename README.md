## Product Description

A **trainer** is a tiny program that hooks into Baldur’s Gate 3 at runtime, letting you toggle wild perks like God Mode, Infinite Actions, or Auto-Success rolls. WeMod’s one-click UI gives you 25-plus switches including health, gold and carry weight cheats , while community-made Cheat Engine tables stack more granular tweaks—think per-ally HP locks, split-stack exploits, and XP blasts . Console-style commands via Script Extender can summon any item UUID in a flash .

## System Requirements 💻

Before juicing Faerûn, make sure your box isn’t the bottleneck. Larian’s official specs call for: 64-bit Win 10, i5-4690 or FX 8350, 8 GB RAM, GTX 970 or RX 480, and 150 GB on an SSD for minimum play; they *recommend* bumping to an i7-8700K / Ryzen 5 3600 and 16 GB RAM for smooth sailing . Trainers hardly add extra load, but low-end rigs may stutter if godlike particle spam floods the screen.

## Installation Instructions 🛠️

1. **Grab the Tool** – Scoop WeMod from its site or fire up Cheat Engine from the official page (avoid shady mirrors) .
2. **Install & Skip Bloat** – Cheat Engine’s installer bundles optional adware—just untick extras while clicking through .
3. **Boot BG3 First** – Launch the game to the main menu, then **attach** WeMod or load the .CT in Cheat Engine and hook the BG3 process .
4. **Toggle Cheats** – Hit play in WeMod or tick boxes in the CT. Some options (like Infinite Movement) may need you to switch into Turn-Based Mode once so the script can capture pawn IDs .
5. **Save-Game Safety** – Back up saves before heavy edits; third-party tweaks can corrupt quests according to GamesRadar’s cautionary note .
6. **Patch-Day Check** – If BG3 updates and cheats glitch, wait for table or trainer revisions—FearlessRevolution threads usually patch within hours .

## Safety & Stability Talk ⚠️

Reddit vets say Cheat Engine itself is clean; antivirus flags it only because it pokes memory, but the installer’s optional extras are the real trap . WeMod streams updates and verifies game builds, yet big patches can still break toggles until the author pushes a fix . When in doubt, run trainers after you’ve finished vanilla play-throughs; glitched quests or broken dice logs aren’t worth perma-borked saves .

## Conclusion 🎉

With the right trainer, Baldur’s Gate 3 turns into a playground where every roll lands nat-20, every chest spits gold, and even Honour Mode bows to your whims. WeMod rules for quick-and-dirty invincibility, Cheat Engine tables unlock obsessive micro-tuning, and Script Extender opens pure sandbox chaos. Fire them up responsibly, back up your saves, and revel in the power trip—just remember, the *real* adventure is the friends you accidentally fireball along the way. 😉
